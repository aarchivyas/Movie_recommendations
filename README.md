ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This is a simple AI-powered movie recommendation system built using Python and pandas. It allows users to get movie suggestions based on their preferred genre or a minimum rating. The interaction is entirely through the command-line, making it easy to run and use for beginners.

This project includes features like filtering movies by genre, recommending movies above a specific rating, and suggesting similar genre movies automatically after the main recommendation.

It was built using Python 3.13.1 and pandas for data handling. The program runs from a single script (app.py) which handles all the logic and user interaction.

To run this project:

Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git and navigate into the folder.

Install the required package using pip install pandas.

Run the project with the command python app.py.

Once launched, it will display three options:

Get recommendations by Genre

Get recommendations based on Rating

Exit

Based on the userâ€™s choice, it will ask for genre or rating and display matching movies with their ratings. If no matches are found, it politely informs the user.

Sample Output:
Welcome to the Movie Recommender!

Get recommendations by Genre

Get recommendations based on Rating

Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter your preferred genre (e.g., Sci-Fi, Action): Sci-Fi

Recommended Movies:
Inception â€“ 8.8
Interstellar â€“ 8.6
The Matrix â€“ 8.7

Here are more movies from the same genre:
Inception â€“ 8.8
Interstellar â€“ 8.6
The Matrix â€“ 8.7

In the future, this system can be enhanced by integrating APIs like TMDB to fetch real-time movie data, allowing user feedback for better recommendations, adding a GUI or web interface, and even implementing AI models like collaborative filtering.

From this project, I learned how to build a basic recommender system using pandas, how to interact with users via the terminal, and how to think about user experience in CLI-based applications.
